    subtitle: "Off-Grid Remote Security System",
    description: "A completely self-contained security monitoring system that operates entirely off-grid, sending real-time notifications through the Meshtastic mesh network.",
    content: `This project started as an excuse to set up a Meshtastic mesh network node, but quickly evolved into a comprehensive off-grid security solution. The system monitors a remote location using solar power and sends push notifications to my phone through the Meshtastic network, ensuring I'm always aware of any activity even when there's no cellular or WiFi coverage.

The beauty of this system lies in its complete independence from traditional infrastructure. It runs entirely on solar power with battery backup, uses LoRa radio for communication through the mesh network, and can operate for months without any external power or network connections.

The project combines hardware hacking, embedded programming, and mesh networking to create something truly unique in the IoT space.`,
