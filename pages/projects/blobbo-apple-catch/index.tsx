    content: `This project represents my dive into retro game development for the original Game Boy hardware. Using GBDK 2020 (Game Boy Development Kit), I created a complete game from scratch that runs on real Game Boy hardware.

The game features Blobbo, a charming character who must catch falling apples while avoiding obstacles. The gameplay is simple yet addictive, with increasing difficulty levels and classic 8-bit graphics that pay homage to the golden age of handheld gaming.

Developing for the Game Boy presented unique challenges including limited memory, monochrome display constraints, and the need to optimize for the Z80 processor. This project taught me valuable lessons about resource management and efficient programming techniques.

The game includes multiple levels, a scoring system, and classic Game Boy sound effects created using the system's sound channels.`,
