    content: `Living in New York City has given me the opportunity to discover countless amazing places, from hidden gems to world-renowned establishments. This project is my personal curation of the best the city has to offer.

The list is organized by neighborhood and category, making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. Whether you're a local looking for new spots or a visitor planning your trip, these recommendations come from years of exploration and countless meals, drinks, and experiences.

Each recommendation includes detailed information about what makes the place special, the best times to visit, and insider tips that only locals would know. The list is constantly updated as I discover new favorites and revisit old ones.

This isn't just a list of popular places - it's a carefully curated selection based on personal experience, quality, and the unique character that makes each spot memorable.`,
