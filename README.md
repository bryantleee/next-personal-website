# Bryant's Personal Website
This is my personal website, written with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). This is a work in progress!

## Running locally
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page will auto-updates as you edit files.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Deployment
This website has been deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
